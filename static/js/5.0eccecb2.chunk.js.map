Why are a lot of intelligent beings of the opinion that He/She doesn’t exist? \n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\tThe answer to this may be, assuming He/She exists, that He/She is just an introvert who likes to leave the world as be and only interfere when required. This also makes sense considering, most of the activities recorded and preserved in the modern digital age are actually sewed, and the outcomes reaped by humans and their products. \n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\tAlmost all the major strategic inflection points seen in tech that I can recall of since early 2000’s from the Ipod in 2001, the APIs in 2003, Facebook in 2004, Youtube in 2005, the Iphone in 2007, the Ipad 2010,  VRs in late 2010s etc apart from the more regular wars, political conflicts etc, were made by and influenced humans. \n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\tIf God were an extravert, He/She would have communicated with the greatest leaders of this era like Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk or Linus Torvalds and helped them change the world a bit more and a bit faster. \n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<h3>Beliefs of humans.</h3>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\tI have always wondered why the most faithful of all humans have backup plans. Isn’t God going to ensure their plans get executed and they were foresighted? If not, why have the faith anyway. I am not encouraging anyone to lose faith here, all I am doing is trying to find out why and how, if at all, God exists.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\tMy realization of this problem is that God is not just an introvert, He/She is probably ignorant of petty issues that mortals face anyway. It may not be computationally feasible for Him/Her at this point in time with the human population at nearly 8 billion. Or it may just happen that the solutions mortals arrive at whilst interacting with each other actually pleases God to an extent that He/She doesn't bother modifying the relations among them or the outcome they conclude. Either way the perspective He/She leaves mortals to ponder is that God might actually be an introvert.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<h3>Another perspective.</h3>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\tA close friend/senior suggested me to start watching the series Lucifer on Netflix, and it helped me see the world in a different way. One important realization I had from it is that God (and Devil) may exist among us and interact with us on a fairly everyday basis and yet leave us unaware (so as to not freak us out). \n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\tIn case the human form of God is an introvert the world would not be much different than it is right now. Therefore the assumption <b>'if God every visits Earth and decides to stay with us, He/She would act like in an introvert'</b> may not be very far fetched.\n\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<Footer\n\t\t\t\tisBlogsArticle={true}\n\t\t\t/>\n\t\t</div>\n\t)\n}\n\nexport default art5\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
