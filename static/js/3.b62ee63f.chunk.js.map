It takes time to build valuable things, and that means delayed revenue. Most of a tech company's value will come at least 10 to 15 years in the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br/><br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTheil skillfully points out quite opposing patterns of success.\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>What to consider when starting tech companies?</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you focus on near-term growth above all else, you miss the most important question you should be asking: will this business still be around a decade from now? \n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNumbers alone won't tell you the answer. Instead you must think critically about the qualitative characteristics of your business.\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>How good should the proprietery tech be?</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTheil says that a good rule of thumb is that proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its closest substitute in some important dimension to lead to a real monopolistic advantage. Anything less than an order of magnitude better will probably be perceived as a marginal improvement and will be hard to sell, especially in an already crowded market.\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>How does sales work?</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLike acting, sales works best when hidden.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br/><br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis explains why almost everyone whose job involves distribution whether they're in sales, marketing, or advertising has a job title that has nothing to do with those things. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br/><br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>People who sell advertising are \"account executives\".</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>People who sell customers are \"business development\".</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>People who sell companies are \"investment bankers\".</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>People who sell themselves are called \"politicians\".</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTheil emphasises the reason being, none of us wants to be reminded when we're being sold.\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>Are engineers skilled enough to sell tech?</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe engineer's grail is a product great enough that \"it sells itself\". But anyone who would actually say this about a real product must be lying: either he's delusional (lying to himself) or he's selling something (and thereby contradicting himself). \n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br/><br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe polar opposite business clich√© warns that \"the best product doesn't always win\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br/><br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEconomists attribute this to \"path dependence\": specific historical circumstances independent of objective quality can determine which products enjoy widespread adoption. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br/><br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTheil brings a conclusion to this dillema by stating: It's better to think of distribution as something essential to the design of your product. If you've invented something new but you haven't invented an effective way to sell it, you have a bad business no matter how good the product.\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>Which problems / projects are the best?</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Doing something different is what's truly good for society and it's also what allows a business to profit by monopolizing a new market.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>The best projects are likely to be overlooked, not trumpeted by a crowd.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>The best problems to work on are often the ones nobody else even tries to solve.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<Footer\n\t\t\t\tisBlogsArticle = {true}\n\t\t\t/>\n\t\t</div>\n\t)\n}\n\nexport default art4\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
