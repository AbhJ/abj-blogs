				<h2>God is an Introvert.</h2>
				<pre>
					<p>
					<i>
I have expressed my personal views in this blog and do not intend to propagate any religious beliefs through this.
					</i>
					</p>
					<p>
					Contrary to what the title may suggest, I am an atheist.
					</p>
					<p>
					This is just going to be my views on what God may be and more specifically a discussion on His/Her personality type.
					</p>
				</pre>
				<h3>How God Works.</h3>
				<p>
					If such a being exists, why does He/She not exhibit His/Her existence? Why are a lot of intelligent beings of the opinion that He/She doesn’t exist?
				</p>
				<p>
					The answer to this may be, assuming He/She exists, that He/She is just an introvert who likes to leave the world as be and only interfere when required. This also makes sense considering, most of the activities recorded and preserved in the modern digital age are sewed, and the outcomes are reaped by humans and their products.
				</p>
				<p>
					Almost all the major strategic inflection points seen in tech that I can recall of since the early 2000s from the iPod in 2001, the APIs in 2003, Facebook in 2004, Youtube in 2005, the iPhone in 2007, the Ipad 2010, VRs in late 2010s, etc apart from the more regular wars, political conflicts, etc, were made by and influenced humans.
				</p>
				<p>
					If God were an extrovert, He/She would have communicated with the greatest leaders of this era like Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, or Linus Torvalds and helped them change the world a bit more and a bit faster.
				</p>
				<h3>Beliefs of humans.</h3>
				<p>
					I have always wondered why the most faithful of all humans have backup plans. Isn’t God going to ensure their plans get executed and they were foresighted? If not, why have the faith anyway? I am not encouraging anyone to lose faith here, all I am doing is trying to find out why and how, if at all, God exists.
				</p>
				<p>
					My realization of this problem is that God is not just an introvert, He/She is probably ignorant of petty issues that mortals face anyway. It may not be computationally feasible for Him/Her at this point with the human population at nearly 8 billion. Or it may just happen that the solutions mortals arrive at whilst interacting with each other pleases God to an extent that He/She doesn't bother modifying the relations among them or the outcome they conclude. Either way, the perspective He/She leaves mortals to ponder is that God might be an introvert.
				</p>
				<h3>Another perspective.</h3>
				<p>
					A close friend/senior suggested I start watching the series Lucifer on Netflix, and it helped me see the world differently. One important realization I had from it is that God <i>(and Devil)</i> may exist among us and interact with us on a fairly everyday basis and yet leave us unaware (to not freak us out).
				</p>
				<p>
					In case the human form of God is an introvert the world would not be much different than it is right now. Therefore the assumption <b>'if God ever visits Earth and decides to stay with us, He/She would act like an introvert'</b> may not be very far-fetched.
