This is my minimalist blog app where I write about tech and software.
The app has been hosted at: [Link](https://abhj.github.io/abj-blogs).
Sometimes I also write about other nerdy topics too.

Design inspiration:
1. Colors have been chosen from open source project [One Dark for Vim](https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim).
2. I have been inspired by youtuber [Distro Tube](https://distrotube.com).
3. Icons have been chosen from [Material Desgin](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign).

Due credits to them.
